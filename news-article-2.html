                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Today marks the official launch of Steel Canvas Studio, but our story began with frustration - frustration with an industry that seemed to have forgotten what gaming was supposed to be about.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">The Breaking Point</h3>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Picture this: I'm sitting in my apartment, having just rage-quit another mobile game after hitting yet another paywall. This wasn't just any game - it was one I'd actually enjoyed for the first few hours. The mechanics were solid, the art was decent, but then came the inevitable squeeze. Pay to progress. Pay to not wait. Pay to have fun.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">That's when it hit me: mobile gaming had become a casino wearing a game's costume. The industry had optimized for extraction, not entertainment. Players weren't customers to delight - they were resources to mine.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">What We Believe</h3>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Steel Canvas Studio exists because we believe players deserve better. We believe games should respect your intelligence, not insult it. We believe in depth over dark patterns, strategy over slot machines, and genuine engagement over engineered addiction.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Our name reflects our philosophy: steel represents strength and durability, while canvas represents the blank potential for creativity. We're building games that are both structurally sound and artistically meaningful.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">Our Commitment</h3>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We commit to transparency in everything we do. When we make mistakes, you'll hear about them. When we face challenges, we'll share them. When we succeed, we'll celebrate together. No corporate speak, no manufactured hype - just honest communication about the realities of indie game development.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">We're not just making games; we're making a statement. Every decision we make asks the question: "Does this respect the player?" If the answer is no, we don't do it. It's that simple.</p>
                            
                            <h3 style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;">The Road Ahead</h3>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Starting with Pocket Legion, every Steel Canvas Studio game will prove that mobile gaming can be better. We're not trying to capture whales - we're trying to create experiences that players genuinely want to engage with because they're fun, challenging, and respectful.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This is just the beginning. We have big dreams and the determination to make them reality. But we can't do it alone - we need players who share our vision of what gaming can be.</p>
