                        <h3>ðŸ’¡ A Moment of Rage</h3>
                        <p>It was 2:30 AM on a Tuesday. I had just rage-quit another mobile game after hitting my fifth paywall in twenty minutes. I threw my phone onto my bed and stared at the ceiling, thinking: "I could build something better than this garbage."</p>
                        
                        <p>That wasn't just frustration talking - it was the moment Steel Canvas Studio was born. Not in a boardroom or a business plan, but in pure, unfiltered anger at an industry that had forgotten what gaming was supposed to be about.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸŽ® The Problem</h3>
                        <p>Mobile gaming had become a predatory wasteland. Every game was the same: flashy graphics hiding manipulative mechanics designed to extract money from players. Timers, energy systems, pay-to-win upgrades - all barriers between players and fun.</p>
                        
                        <p>The worst part? Players were accepting it. They'd been conditioned to believe this was just how mobile games worked. But I remembered when games were about challenge, discovery, and genuine enjoyment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸ”¥ The Decision</h3>
                        <p>I made a promise to myself that night: I would build games that respected players' time, intelligence, and wallets. Games that prioritized fun over revenue, strategy over manipulation, and player satisfaction over addiction metrics.</p>
                        
                        <p>It wasn't about being anti-profit - it was about proving that ethical game development could be profitable without exploiting players.</p>

                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸ“š Learning Everything</h3>
                        <p>I quit my day job and dove headfirst into game development. Unity tutorials at 3 AM, C# documentation over breakfast, game design theory during lunch breaks at my backup job. Every free moment was spent learning how to turn frustration into creation.</p>
                        
                        <p>YouTube University became my classroom. Stack Overflow became my lifeline. Coffee became my fuel. The dream was simple: build games so good that players would forget mobile gaming was ever broken.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>âš¡ The First Prototype</h3>
                        <p>Pocket Legion started as a joke. "What if I made a crowd-running game that actually required strategy?" I thought it would take a weekend. It took six months to build something I wasn't embarrassed to show people.</p>
                        
                        <p>But when I finally had a working prototype, something magical happened: people played it for hours without spending a penny. They were having fun. Pure, unmonetized, genuine fun.</p>

                    <div class="game-card">

                        <p>Steel Canvas Studio isn't just a company name - it's a philosophy. Steel represents durability and strength. Canvas represents creativity and potential. Together, they represent games built to last, made with artistic integrity.</p>
                        
                        <p>We're not trying to be the biggest studio. We're trying to be the studio that proves ethical game development isn't just possible - it's profitable, sustainable, and infinitely more rewarding.</p>

                        <h3>ðŸš€ Beyond Mobile</h3>
                        <p>Pocket Legion is just the beginning. We're planning PC releases, console ports, and eventually original IP that spans multiple platforms. But every game will maintain our core principle: respect the player.</p>
                        
                        <p>We want to build games that parents feel good about letting their kids play. Games that don't exploit addiction psychology or predatory monetization. Games that are simply, genuinely fun.</p>

                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸ‘¥ Building a Team</h3>
                        <p>Right now, it's just me in my apartment, surviving on coffee and determination. But I'm building something bigger. As revenue grows, so will the team. Every hire will share our values and commitment to ethical development.</p>
                        
                        <p>I want to create a studio where developers are proud of their work, where creativity is valued over crunch, and where everyone has a stake in our collective success.</p>

                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸŒŸ Industry Impact</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate goal isn't just to make great games - it's to prove that the entire industry can do better. Every successful ethical release is a small victory against predatory monetization.</p>
                        
                        <p>We want other studios to look at Steel Canvas and think: "If they can build profitable games without exploiting players, so can we." That's how real change happens - one ethical game at a time.</p>

                        <h3>ðŸ’­ Why This Matters</h3>
                        <p>Gaming saved my life as a kid. When everything else was falling apart, games were a safe space where effort was rewarded, where challenges had solutions, and where imagination could run wild.</p>
                        
                        <p>Watching that same medium become a tool for exploitation breaks my heart. But it also fuels my determination. Every player who enjoys our games without feeling manipulated or exploited is a small victory for what gaming can be.</p>
                        
                        <p>Steel Canvas Studio isn't just my company - it's my love letter to the industry that shaped me, and my promise to help it become what it's supposed to be: a place where creativity, challenge, and genuine fun matter more than quarterly profits.</p>

                    <div class="game-card">
                        <h3>ðŸŽ® For the Players</h3>
                        <p>To everyone who's ever been frustrated by a mobile game paywall, who's ever felt manipulated by a timer system, who's ever wondered why games can't just be fun anymore - this is for you.</p>
                        
                        <p>You deserve better. Games should challenge you, entertain you, and respect you. They shouldn't exploit your psychology or empty your wallet. That's the Steel Canvas promise.</p>
