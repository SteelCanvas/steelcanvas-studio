                        <p>Today marks the official launch of Steel Canvas Studio, but our story began with frustration - frustration with an industry that seemed to have forgotten what gaming was supposed to be about.

                        <p>Ever wondered how a solo developer builds games while dreaming of becoming the next big indie studio? Here's an honest look at our current setup and workflow.

                        <p>Most studios build games first, then find players. We're doing it backwards - building community first because games are better when players help shape them.
